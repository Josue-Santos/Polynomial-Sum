# Comp 3450 Project 4

Author: Matheus Ribeiro & Josue Santos

##################################################Please Regrade PROJECT 3#############################################

## Instructions

No special instructions are necessary to use the program. It reads an polynomial from the main stream and outputs the respective operation value.

## Strengths

In this program we can use operators to caluculate the value of our polynomial.  We are using one compare function for all 24 for main operators. We make 4 operators globals.

## Weaknesses

We fixed the bugs from the previous project and after testing them again we have not find any bugs. 

## Efficiency

We add more operators that we did not have in the previous projects. Easy usage for the user. All the properties that our class uses are encapsulated. After test our program
we improve the efficiency making only one compare fuction for terms and doubles, instead creating two mores and making the program slower. 

We could write conversion operators from Term to Double or Double to Term. Another way we could improve it is by doing the extra credit assignments.
